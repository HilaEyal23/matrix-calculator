# matrix-calculator
**matrix calculator written in c**
>About the calculator :

This program parses a given txt file according to spesific syntax and executes it's commands (in case no errors found) otherwise it writes errors back to the user. 

>Our functions :

`read_mat(mat ,values[])` - puts a given numberic values into the given matrix field according to order.

`print_mat(mat)` - prints the given matrix.

`add_mat(mat1, mat2, mat3)` - puts in the theird matrix the sum of two given matrixes.

`sub_mat(mat1, mat2, mat3)` - puts in the theird matrix the sub of two given matrixes.

`mul_mat(mat1, mat2, mat3)` - puts in the theird matrix the matrix multiplication of two given matrices.

`mul_scalar(mat1, scalar , mat2)` - puts in the second matrix the scalar multiplication of given matrix and scalar.

`trans_mat(mat1, mat2)` - puts in the second matrix the matrix transformation of first given matrix.

`stop(void)` - stops the program 

>Our matrixs :

* MAT_A
* MAT_B
* MAT_C
* MAT_D
* MAT_E
* MAT_F
